        </div>
        <b>Most users</b> did <b>not have trouble</b> and were <b>not bothered</b> while using the interface. 
        General patterns include users <b>waiting for the paper to print</b>: tapping their feet, 
        organizing sheets of paper, and/or on their phone.<br><br>
        <b>New users</b> however, <b>had trouble and were confused</b>. Brown's printing system 
        <b>instructions</b> were <b>not</b> in <b>plain view</b> and going on <b>myprint.brown.edu</b>, 
        the first step, was <b>not intuitive</b>. New users took <b>a lot of time</b> and <b>were confused</b> 
        throughout the process.<br><br>

        </div>
    The most important things for a printing system is for it to be <b>fast, simple, accessible, color, and cheap.</b><br><br>
    Brown's printing system has a <b>high learning curve</b> and is <b>not intuitive</b> for new users, but has <b>decent 
    memorability</b> and <b>good efficiency</b><br><br>
    The first half, going on <b>myprint.brown.edu</b>, was <b>not intuitive</b> and full of statistics and jargon. 
    The <b>upload/submit job button</b> was <b>not</b> in <b>plain view</b>.<br><br>
    The second half, the print release station was <b>intuitive</b>, <b>in plain view</b>, but was <b>misleading</b>- 
    it seemed like the first step instead of being the last.<br><br>
    Brown's printing system was used mostly <b>for classes and extracurriculars</b> printing things such as sheet music, 
    kanji sheets, study guides, posters, and papers.<br><br>
